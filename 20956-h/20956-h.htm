<span class="i0">To-night beneath my cottage eaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While smitten by a lofty moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The encircling laurels thick with leaves,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A pleased attention I may win<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To agitations less severe,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rich metals and sweet odors now declare<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To clear us from the base and loathsome flood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of sense and make us fit for angel's food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lift to God for us the holy smoke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fervent prayers with which we Him invoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And try our actions in the searching fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By which the seraphims our lips inspire:<br /></span>

<span class="i8">To us poor wassailers, etc.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Your wife shall be a fruitful vine, a hus'sif good and able;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your children like the olive branches round about your table;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your barns shall burst with plenty and your crops shall be secure,<br /></span>

<h3>THE MASQUE OF CHRISTMAS.</h3>

<h5>(AS IT WAS PRESENTED AT COURT, 1616.)</h5>


<p class="center"><i>The Court being seated</i>,</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Christmas</span>, <i>with two or three of the guard,
attired in round hose, long stockings, a close
doublet, a high-crowned hat, with a brooch, a
long, thin beard, a truncheon, little ruffs, white
shoes, his scarfs and garters tied cross, and his
drum beaten before him.</i></p>

<p>Why, gentlemen, do you know what you do?
ha! would you have kept me out? Christmas,
old Christmas, Christmas of London, and Captain
Christmas? Pray you, let me be brought
before my lord chamberlain, I'll not be answered
else: <i>'Tis merry in hall, when beards wag all:</i>
I have seen the time you have wish'd for me
for a merry Christmas; and now you have me,
they would not let me in: <i>I must come another
time!</i> a good jest, as if I could come more than
once a year! Why, I am no dangerous person,
and so I told my friends of the guard. I am
old Gregory Christmas still, and though I come
out of Pope's-head alley, as good a Protestant
as any in my parish. The truth is, I have
brought a Masque here, out o' the city, of my
own making, and do present it by a set of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg&nbsp;131]</a></span>
sons, that come out of the lanes of London,
good dancing boys all. It was intended, I confess,
for Curriers Hall; but because the weather
has been open, and the Livery were not at
leisure to see it till a frost came, that they cannot
work, I thought it convenient, with some
little alterations, and the groom of the revels'
hand to 't, to fit it for a higher place; which I
have done, and though I say it, another manner
of device than your New-Year's-night. Bones
o' bread, the king! (<i>seeing King James.</i>) Son
Rowland! Son Clem! be ready there in a trice:
quick, boys!<br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Enter his Sons and Daughters, (ten in number,)
led in, in a string, by Cupid, who is attired in a
flat cap, and a prentice's coat, with wings at his
shoulders.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Misrule</span>, <i>in a velvet cap, with a sprig, a short
cloak, great yellow ruff, like a reveller, his torch-bearer
bearing a rope, a cheese, and a basket.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Carol</span>, <i>a long tawny coat, with a red cap, and
a flute at his girdle, his torch-bearer carrying a
song-book open.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Minced-Pie</span>, <i>like a fine cook's wife, drest neat;
her man carrying a pie, dish, and spoons.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Gambol</span>, <i>like a tumbler, with a hoop and bells;
his torch-bearer armed with a colt-staff, and a
binding cloth.</i></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg&nbsp;132]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Post and Pair</span>, <i>with a pair-royal of aces in his
hat; his garment all done over with pairs and
purs; his squire carrying a box, cards, and
counters.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">New-Year's-Gift</span>, <i>in a blue coat, serving-man like,
with an orange, and a sprig of rosemary gilt on
his head, his hat full of brooches, with a collar
of ginger-bread, his torch-bearer carrying a
march-pane with a bottle of wine on either arm.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mumming</span>, <i>in a masquing pied suit, with a vizard,
his torch-bearer carrying the box, and ringing it.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wassel</span>, <i>like a neat sempster and songster; her
page bearing a brown bowl, drest with ribands,
and rosemary before her.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Offering</span>, <i>in a short gown, with a porter's staff in
his hand, a wyth born before him, and a bason,
by his torch-bearer.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Baby-Cake</span>, <i>drest like a boy, in a fine long coat,
biggin-bib, muckender, and a little dagger; his
usher bearing a great cake, with a bean and a
pease.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>They enter singing.</i></p>

<p class="center"><br /><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Venus</span>, <i>a deaf tire-woman.</i><br /><br /></p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Now, all the lords bless me! where am
I, trow? where is Cupid? "Serve the king!"
they may serve the cobbler well enough, some
of 'em, for any courtesy they have, I wisse;
they have need o' mending: unrude people they
are, your courtiers; here was thrust upon thrust
indeed: was it ever so hard to get in before,
trow?</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> How now? what's the matter?</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> A place, forsooth, I do want a place: I
would have a good place, to see my child act in
before the king and queen's majesties, God bless
'em! to-night.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Why, here is no place for you.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Right, forsooth, I am Cupid's mother,
Cupid's own mother, forsooth; yes, forsooth: I
dwell in Pudding-lane: ay, forsooth, he is prentice
in Love-lane, with a bugle maker, that
makes of your bobs, and bird-bolts for ladies.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Good lady Venus of Pudding-lane, you
must go out for all this.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Yes, forsooth, I can sit anywhere, so I
may see Cupid act: he is a pretty child, though
I say it, that perhaps should not, you will say.
I had him by my first husband; he was a smith,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg&nbsp;135]</a></span>
forsooth, we dwelt in Do-little-lane then: he
came a month before his time, and that may
make him somewhat imperfect; but I was a
fishmonger's daughter.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> No matter for your pedigree, your
house: good Venus, will you depart?</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Ay, forsooth, he'll say his part, I warrant
him, as well as e'er a play-boy of 'em all:
I could have had money enough for him, an I
would have been tempted, and have let him out
by the week to the king's players. Master
Burbage has been about and about with me,
and so has old master Hemings, too, they have
need of him; where is he, trow, ha! I would
fain see him&mdash;pray God they have given him
some drink since he came.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Are you ready, boys? Strike up!
nothing will drown this noise but a drum:
a'peace, yet! I have not done. Sing,&mdash;</p>

his pur-dogs.</p>

porter's, to beg or borrow a pair of cards
quickly?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg&nbsp;136]</a></span>

Cheater without, has cards in his pocket.</p>

<p><i>Offer.</i> Ods so! speak to the guards to let him
in, under the name of a property.</p>

<p><i>Gam.</i> And here's New-Year's-Gift has an
orange and rosemary, but not a clove to stick
in't.</p>

<p><i>New-Year.</i> Why, let one go to the spicery.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Fy, fy, fy! it's naught, it's naught, boys.</p>

<p><i>Ven.</i> Why, I have cloves, if it be cloves you
want. I have cloves in my purse: I never go
without one in my mouth.</p>

<p><i>Car.</i> And Mumming has not his vizard,
neither.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> No matter! his own face shall serve,
for a punishment, and 'tis bad enough; has
Wassel her bowl, and Minced-pie her spoons?</p>

<p><i>Offer.</i> Ay, ay: but Misrule doth not like his
suit: he says the players have sent him one too
little, on purpose to disgrace him.</p>

<p><i>Chris.</i> Let him hold his peace, and his disgrace

<h3>A VISIT FROM ST. NICHOLAS.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mamma in her kerchief and I in my cap<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave the lustre of day to the objects below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When what to my wondering eyes should appear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a little old driver so lively and quick<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg&nbsp;146]</a></span>
<span class="i0">More rapid than eagles, his coursers they came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer! now, Vixen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Dunder and Blixen!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the top of the stoop, to the top of the wall!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As dry leaves before the wild hurricane fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So up to the house-top the coursers they flew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I drew in my head and was turning around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was dressed all in furs from his head to his foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bundle of toys he had flung on his back;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg&nbsp;147]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a broad face, and a little round belly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A wink of his eye and a twist of his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And filled all the stockings, then turned with a jerk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"<br /></span>

<h3>THE HARD TIMES IN ELFLAND.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Strange that the termagant winds should scold<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Christmas Eve so bitterly!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Wife, and Harry, the four-year old,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Big Charley, Nimblewits, and I,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Blithe as the wind was bitter, drew<br /></span>

<span class="i1">The heaven that Christian dogs desire&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Stretched o'er the rug, serene and grave,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Huge nose on heavy paws reclined,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With never a drowning boy to save,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And warmth of body and peace of mind.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And as our happy circle sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The fire well capp'd the company:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In grave debate or careless chat,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A right good fellow, mingled he:<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">He seemed as one of us to sit,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And talked of things above, below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With flames more winsome than our wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And coals that burned like love aglow.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg&nbsp;149]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While thus our rippling discourse rolled<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Smooth down the channel of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We spoke of Time: thereat, one told<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A parable of the seasons' flight.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Those seasons out, we talked of these:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And I, with inward purpose sly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To shield my purse from Christmas-trees,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And stockings, and wild robbery<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When Hal and Nimblewits invade<br /></span>
<span class="i1">My cash in Santa Claus's name,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In full the hard, hard times surveyed,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Denounced all waste as crime and shame;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hinted that "waste" might be a term<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Including skates, velocipedes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kites, marbles, soldiers, towers infirm,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Bows, arrows, cannon, Indian reeds,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Cap-pistols, drums, mechanic toys,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all th' infernal host of horns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereby to strenuous hells of noise<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Are turned the blessed Christmas morns;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus, roused&mdash;those horns! to sacred rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I rose, forefinger high in air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Harry cried, some war to wage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"Papa is hard times ev'ywhere?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg&nbsp;150]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"Maybe in Santa Claus's land<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It isn't hard times none at all!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now, blessed vision! to my hand<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Most pat, a marvel strange did fall.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scarce had my Harry ceased, when "Look!"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He cried, leapt up in wild alarm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran to my Comrade, shelter took<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Beneath the startled mother's arm,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And so was still: what time we saw<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A foot hang down the fireplace! Then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With painful scrambling, scratched and raw,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Two hands that seemed like hands of men,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Eased down two legs and a body through<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The blazing fire, and forth there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before our wide and wondering view<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A figure shrinking half with shame,<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And half with weakness. "Sir," I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">&mdash;But with a mien of dignity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seedy stranger raised his head:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"My friends, I'm Santa Claus," said he.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But oh, how changed! That rotund face<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The new moon rivall'd, pale and thin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where once was cheek, now empty space;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Whate'er stood out, did now stand in.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg&nbsp;151]</a></span>
<span class="i0">His piteous legs scarce propped him up;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">His arms mere sickles seemed to be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But most o'erflowed our sorrow's cup<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When that we saw&mdash;or did not see&mdash;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His belly: we remembered how<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It shook like a bowl of jelly fine:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An earthquake could not shake it now;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He had no belly&mdash;not a sign.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes, yes, old friends, you well may stare:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I have seen better days," he said:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"But now with shrinkage, loss, and care,<br /></span>

<h3>MRS. SANTA CLAUS.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The moon was like a frosted cake,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The stars like flashing beads<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That round a brimming punch-bowl break<br /></span>
<span class="i1">'Mid spice and almond seeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here and there a silver beam<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Made bright some curling cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Uprising like the wassail's stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Blown off by laughter loud.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It was the night of Christmas Eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And good old Santa Claus<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His door was just about to leave,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">When something made him pause:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I haven't kissed my wife," quoth he,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"I haven't said good-by."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So back he went and lovingly<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He kissed her cap awry.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now Mrs. Claus is just a bit&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The least bit&mdash;of a shrew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What wonder? Only think of it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She has so much to do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Imagine all the stocking-legs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of every size and shape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hang upon their Christmas pegs<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With greedy mouths agape.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg&nbsp;159]</a></span>
<span class="i0">These she must fill, and when you see<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The northern skies aflame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With quivering light, 'tis only she&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This very quaint old dame&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Striking a match against the Pole<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her whale-oil lamp to light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she may see to work, poor soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At making toys all night.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Odd he should kiss me," this she said<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Before the sleigh had gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"'Tis many a year since we were wed;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I'll follow him anon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For faithless husbands, one and all,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ere on their loves they wait,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their wives' suspicion to forestall<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Seem most affectionate."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So, pulling on her seal-skin sacque,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Into her husband's sleigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She slipped, and hid behind his pack<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Just as he drove away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Great Bears!" growled Santa in his beard,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"A goodly freight have I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were't fouler weather, I had feared<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The glacier path to try."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet none the less they safely sped<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Across the realms of snow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg&nbsp;160]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The glittering planets overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The sparkling frost below&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until the reindeer stopped before<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A mansion tall and fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to whose wide and lofty door<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Inclined a marble stair.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So soundly all its inmates slept,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They heard no stroke of hoof;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No fall of foot as Santa leapt<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From pavement unto roof.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, down the chimney like a sweep<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He crept, and after him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went Mrs. Claus to have a peep<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At chambers warm and dim.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As luck would have it, there was hung<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A stocking by the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wear which no one over-young<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Could fittingly aspire:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Long, slender, graceful&mdash;it was just<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The thing to fill the heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Mrs. C. with deep distrust;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And&mdash;well&mdash;it played its part.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Scowling, she watched her husband fill<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The silken foot and leg<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bonbons, fruit, and toys until<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It almost broke its peg.<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg&nbsp;161]</a></span>
<span class="i0">"My!" whispered Santa, "here's a crop.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">This little boy is wise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knows I fill 'em to the top,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No matter what the size."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But Mrs. Claus misunderstood,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like every jealous wife;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She <i>would</i> make bad things out of good,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To feed her inward strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Snapped she unto herself: "The minx<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sha'n't have a single thing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll take 'em home again, methinks,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor leave a stick or string!"<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So said, so done; and all that night<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She followed Santa's wake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as he stuffed the stockings tight,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">She every one did take,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stowing them all unseen away,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In order grimly neat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Within the dark box of the sleigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">All underneath the seat.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when gray dawn broke, and all<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The bells began to peal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tiny forms down many a hall<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And stairway 'gan to steal,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg&nbsp;162]</a></span>
<span class="i0">In vain each chimney-piece they sought&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Those weeping girls and boys&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Christmas morn had come and brought<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No candy and no toys.<br /></span>

<h3>SANTA CLAUS TO LITTLE ETHEL.</h3>

<h5>(IN ANSWER TO HER LETTER, GIVING HIM A LIST OF
HER CHRISTMAS WANTS.)</h5>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">My dear little Ethel,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I fear that the breath'll<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be out of our bodies before we get through;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Day in and day out<br /></span>
<span class="i3">We are rushing about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you haven't a notion how much there's to do.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Ever since last December,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When you may remember<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I paid you a visit at dear Elsinore,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">There's not been a minute<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With a resting-place in it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my nose has not once been outside of the door.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">My shop has been going,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">My bellows a-blowing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My hammers and tongs and a thousand odd tools,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Never give up the battle,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But click, bang, and rattle<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like ten million children in ten thousand schools.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg&nbsp;164]</a></span>
<span class="i3">Dear me, but I'm weary!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And yet, my small deary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I read all the letters as fast as they come;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">If I didn't,&mdash;good gracious!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The house is not spacious,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the letters would soon squeeze me out of my home.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"I would like a nice sled,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And a dolly's soft bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a night-gown and bed-clothes of pretty bright stuffs,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And paints, and a case<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Where my books I may place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And besides all these things, Dolly's collars and cuffs."<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">That's a pretty big list!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But may I be kissed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the back of my head by a crazy mule's hoof,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">If the list I don't fill,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Though it takes all the skill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of every stout workman beneath my broad roof.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">"Hans, Yakob, and Karl!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Let me not hear a snarl,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg&nbsp;165]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or a growl, or a grumble come out of your heads;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">To work now, instanter!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Trot, gallop, and canter,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And finish this job ere you go to your beds!"<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">So I set them to work<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With a jump and a jerk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everything's finished in beautiful style.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Christmas Eve's here again,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And I'm off with my train,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Every reindeer prepared for ten seconds a mile.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">I shall slip down the flue<br /></span>
<span class="i3">With this letter for you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So softly, for fear I your slumbers might break.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Not a word will I speak,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But I'll kiss your soft cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be gone in a jiffy, before you awake.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Should you find I've forgot<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Any part of the lot<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I ordered prepared and all marked with your name,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Let me just add a word,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">So if that has occurred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will know just exactly how I was to blame.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">The fact is, my dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">As I go, year by year,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg&nbsp;166]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Up and down these straight chimneys, while you are in bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The bumps and the scratches<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That Santa Claus catches<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have rubbed all the hair from the top of his head.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">And my brain being bare<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Of my cover of hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is rapidly losing its power, my pet!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Sometimes, after all's fixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I get everything mixed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you must forgive if I ever forget.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">Good-by, Ethel dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i3">May the coming New Year<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bring all kinds of blessings to you from above;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Make you happier and better:<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And so my long letter<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Must close, with a great deal of Santa Claus's love.<br /></span>

<h3>CHRISTMAS IN INDIA.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">

<span class="i0">Dim dawn the tamarisks&mdash;the sky is saffron-yellow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As the women in the village grind the corn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the parrots seek the riverside, each calling to his fellow<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That the day, the staring eastern day, is born.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, the white dust on the highway! Oh, the stenches in the by-way!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, the clammy fog that hovers over earth!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at home they're making merry 'neath the white and scarlet berry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">What part have India's exiles in their mirth?<br /></span>
</div>

<span class="i0">Full day behind the tamarisks&mdash;the sky is blue and staring&mdash;<br /></span>

<span class="i1">As at home the Christmas Day is breaking wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They will drink our healths at dinner&mdash;those who tell us how they love us,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And forget us till another year be gone!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, the toil that knows no breaking! Oh! the heimweh, ceaseless, aching!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Oh, the black, dividing sea and alien plain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth was cheap&mdash;wherefore we sold it. Gold was good&mdash;we hoped to hold it,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Gray dusk behind the tamarisks&mdash;the parrots fly together&mdash;<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Black night behind the tamarisks&mdash;the owls begin their chorus&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As the conches from the temple scream and bray.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the fruitless years behind us and the hopeless years before us,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let us honor, O, my brothers, Christmas Day!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Call a truce, then, to our labors&mdash;let us feast with friends and neighbors,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And be merry as the custom of our caste;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, if "faint and forced the laughter," and if sadness follow after,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We are richer by one mocking Christmas past.<br /></span>

<h3>CHRISTMAS VIOLETS.</h3>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Last night I found the violets<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You sent me once across the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From gardens that the winter frets,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">In summer lands they came to me.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Still fragrant of the English earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Still humid from the frozen dew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To me they spoke of Christmas mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They spoke of England, spoke of you.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The flowers are scentless, black, and sere,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The perfume long has passed away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sea whose tides are year by year<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is set between us, chill and gray.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But you have reached a windless age,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The haven of a happy clime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You do not dread the winter's rage,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Although we missed the summer-time.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And like the flower's breath over sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Across the gulf of time and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-night returns the memory<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of love that lived not all in vain.<br /></span>

<h3>A GRIEF AT CHRISTMAS.</h3>

<h5>FROM "IN MEMORIAM."</h5>


<h4><i>First Year.</i></h4>

<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The time draws near the birth of Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The moon is hid; the night is still;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Christmas bells from hill to hill<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Answer each other in the mist.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Four voices of four hamlets round,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">From far and near, on mead and moor,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Swell out and fail, as if a door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were shut between me and the sound:<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Each voice four changes on the wind,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That now dilate, and now decrease,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Peace and good-will, good-will and peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace and good-will, to all mankind.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This year I slept and woke with pain,<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg&nbsp;177]</a></span>
<span class="i0">But they my troubled spirit rule,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">For they controll'd me when a boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They bring me sorrow touched with joy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The merry merry bells of Yule.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With such compelling cause to grieve<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As daily vexes household peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And chains regret to his decease,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How dare we keep our Christmas-eve;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Which brings no more a welcome guest<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To enrich the threshold of our night<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With shower'd largess of delight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In dance and song and game and jest.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Yet go, and while the holly boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Entwine the cold baptismal font,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Make one wreath more for Use and Wont,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That guard the portals of the house;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Old sisters of a day gone by,<br /></span>

<span class="i1">Why should they miss their yearly due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before their time? They too will die.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With trembling fingers did we weave<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The holly round the Christmas hearth;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A rainy cloud possess'd the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sadly fell our Christmas-eve.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg&nbsp;178]</a></span>
<span class="i0">At our old pastimes in the hall<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We gambol'd, making vain pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of gladness, with an awful sense<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one mute Shadow watching all.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We paused: the winds were in the beech:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We heard them sweep the winter land;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And in a circle hand-in-hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat silent, looking each at each.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then echo-like our voices rang;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We sung, tho' every eye was dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A merry song we sang with him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last year: impetuously we sang:<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We ceased: a gentler feeling crept<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon us: surely rest is meet.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"They rest," we said, "their sleep is sweet,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silence follow'd, and we wept.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our voices took a higher range;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Once more we sang: "They do not die<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Nor lose their mortal sympathy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor change to us, although they change;<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rapt from the fickle and the frail<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With gather'd power, yet the same<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Pierces the keen seraphic flame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From orb to orb, from veil to veil."<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Rise, happy morn, rise, holy morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Draw forth the cheerful day from night:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">O Father, touch the east, and light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light that shone when Hope was born.<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The yule-clog sparkled keen with frost,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The quiet sense of something lost.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As in the winters left behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Again our ancient games had place,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The mimic picture's breathing grace,<br /></span>

</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Who show'd a token of distress?<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No single tear, no mark of pain:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">O grief, can grief be changed to less?<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O last regret, regret can die!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">No&mdash;mixt with all this mystic frame,<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A single peal of bells below,<br /></span>

<h3>MY SISTER'S SLEEP.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She fell asleep on Christmas-eve:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">At length the long-ungranted shade<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of weary eyelids overweigh'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pain naught else might yet relieve.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our mother, who had leaned all day<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Over the bed from chime to chime,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Then raised herself for the first time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as she sat her down did pray.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Her little work-table was spread<br /></span>
<span class="i1">With work to finish. For the glare<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Made by her candle, she had care<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To work some distance from the bed.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Without there was a cold moon up,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of winter radiance sheer and thin;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The hollow halo it was in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was like an icy crystal cup.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Through the small room, with subtle sound<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Of flame, by vents the fireshine drove<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And reddened. In its dim alcove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mirror shed a clearness round.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg&nbsp;184]</a></span>
<span class="i0">I had been sitting up some nights,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And my tired mind felt weak and blank;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Like a sharp, strengthening wine it drank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stillness and the broken lights.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Twelve struck. That sound, by dwindling years<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Heard in each hour, crept off; and then<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The ruffled silence spread again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like water that a pebble stirs.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our mother rose from where she sat:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Her needles, as she laid them down,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Met lightly, and her silken gown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Settled: no other noise than that.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Glory unto the Newly Born,"<br /></span>
<span class="i1">So as said angels, she did say;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Because we were in Christmas-day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though it would still be long till morn.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Just then in the room over us<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There was a pushing back of chairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As some one had sat unawares<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So late, now heard the hour, and rose.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">With anxious, softly-stepping haste<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Our mother went where Margaret lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fearing the sounds o'erhead&mdash;should they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have broken her long-watched-for rest!<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg&nbsp;185]</a></span>
<span class="i0">She stooped an instant, calm, and turned;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But suddenly turned back again;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And all her features seemed in pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With woe, and her eyes gazed and yearned.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">For my part, I but hid my face,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And held my breath, and spoke no word;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">There was none spoken; but I heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The silence for a little space.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our mother bowed herself and wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And both my arms fell, and I said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">"God knows I knew that she was dead,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there, all white, my sister slept.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then kneeling upon Christmas morn<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A little after twelve o'clock,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">We said, ere the first quarter struck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Christ's blessing on the newly born!"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The children in bewildering delight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a living glory in the air,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A glory in the hushed air, in the soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A palpitating wonder hushed in awe.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Softly&mdash;with delicate softness&mdash;as the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quickens in the undawned east; and silently&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With definite silence&mdash;as the stealing dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dapples the floating clouds, slow fall, slow fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With indecisive motion eddying down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The white-winged flakes,&mdash;calm as the sleep of sound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dim as a dream. The silver-misted air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shines with mild radiance, as when through a cloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of semilucent vapor shines the moon.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw last evening (when the ruddy sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Enlarged and strange, sank low and visibly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Spreading fierce orange o'er the west) a scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of winter in his milder mood. Green fields,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which no kine cropped, lay damp; and naked trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Threw skeleton shadows. Hedges, thickly grown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Twined into compact firmness, with no leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Trembled in jewelled fretwork as the sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To lustre touched the tremulous water-drops.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alone, nor whistling as his fellows do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In fabling poem and provincial song,<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg&nbsp;207]</a></span>
<span class="i0">The ploughboy shouted to his reeking train;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at the clamor, from a neighboring field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Arose, with whirr of wings, a flock of rooks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More clamorous; and through the frosted air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blown wildly here and there without a law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They flew, low-grumbling out loquacious croaks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Red sunset brightened all things; streams ran red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet coldly; and before the unwholesome east,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Searching the bones and breathing ice, blew down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hill, with a dry whistle, by the fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chamber twilight rested I at home.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But now what revelation of fair change,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Giver of the seasons and the days!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Creator of all elements, pale mists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Invisible great winds and exact frost!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I speak the wonder of thy snow?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What though we know its essence and its birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can quick expound, in philosophic wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The how, and whence, and manner of its fall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, oh, the inner beauty and the life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The life that is in snow! The virgin-soft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And utter purity of the down-flake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Falling upon its fellow with no sound!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unblown by vulgar winds, innumerous flakes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fall gently, with the gentleness of love!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The earth is cherished, for beneath the soft,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pure uniformity is gently born<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg&nbsp;208]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Warmth and rich mildness, fitting the dead roots<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the resuscitation of the spring.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now while I write, the wonder clothes the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calmed every wind and loaded every grove;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looking through the implicated boughs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I see a gleaming radiance. Sparkling snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Refined by morning-footed frost so still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mantles each bough; and such a windless hush<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Breathes through the air, it seems the fairy glen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About some phantom palace, pale abode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fabled Sleeping Beauty. Songless birds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flit restlessly about the breathless wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waiting the sudden breaking of the charm;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as they quickly spring on nimble wing<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the white twig, a sparkling shower falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Starlike. It is not whiteness, but a clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Outshining of all purity, which takes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The winking eyes with such a silvery gleam.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sunshine, and the sky is all one cloud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vale seems lonely, ghostlike; while aloud<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The housewife's voice is heard with doubled sound.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have not words to speak the perfect show;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The ravishment of beauty; the delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of silent purity; the sanctity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of inspiration which o'erflows the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making it breathless with divinity.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg&nbsp;209]</a></span>
<span class="i0">So thus with fair delapsion softly falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred shower; and when the shortened day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dejected dies in the low streaky west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rising moon displays a cold blue night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And keen as steel the east wind sprinkles ice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thicker than bees, about the waxing moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gather the punctual stars. Huge whitened hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rise glimmering to the blue verge of the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ghostlike, and striped with narrow glens of firs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Black-waving, solemn. O'er the Luggie-stream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gathers a veiny film of ice, and creeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With elfin feet around each stone and reed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Working fine masonry; while o'er the dam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dashing, a noise of waters fills the clear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And nitrous air. All the dark, wintry hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharply the winds from the white level moors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Keen whistle. Timorous in his homely bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The school-boy listens, fearful lest gaunt wolves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or beasts, whose uncouth forms in ancient books<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has beheld, at creaking shutters pull<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Howling. And when at last the languid dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In wind redness re-illumines the east<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ineffectual fire, an intense blue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Severely vivid o'er the snowy hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gleams chill, while hazy, half-transparent clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slow-range the freezing ether of the west.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the woods the keenly vehement blasts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wail, and disrobe the mantled boughs, and fling<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A snow-dust everywhere. Thus wears the day:<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg&nbsp;210]</a></span>
<span class="i0">While grandfather over the well-watched fire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs cowering, with a cold drop at his nose.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Now underneath the ice the Luggie growls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the polished smoothness curlers come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rudely ambitious. Then for happy hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The clinking stones are slid from wary hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Barleycorn, best wine for surly airs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bites i' th' mouth, and ancient jokes are cracked.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And oh, the journey homeward, when the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Low-rounding to the west, in ruddy glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinks large, and all the amber-skirted clouds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His flaming retinue, with dark'ning glow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Diverge! The broom is brandished as the sign<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of conquest, and impetuously they boast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of how this shot was played,&mdash;with what a bend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peculiar&mdash;the perfection of all art&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That stone came rolling grandly to the Tee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With victory crowned, and flinging wide the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lordly crash! Within the village inn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They by the roaring chimney sit, and quaff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The beaded Usqueba with sugar dashed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O, when the precious liquid fires the brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To joy, and every heart beats fast with mirth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ancient fellowship, what nervy grasps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of horny hands o'er tables of rough oak!<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg&nbsp;211]</a></span>

<h3>THE END OF THE PLAY.</h3>


<div class="cpoem">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The play is done; the curtain drops,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Slow falling to the prompter's bell;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment yet the actor stops<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And looks around to say farewell.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is an irksome word and task;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And, when he's laughed and said his say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shows, as he removes the mask,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A face that's anything but gay.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">One word ere yet the evening ends;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let's close it with a parting rhyme,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pledge a hand to all young friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As fits the merry Christmas-time.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On life's wide scene you, too, have parts,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That fate erelong shall bid you play;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good-night! with honest, gentle hearts<br /></span>
<span class="i1">A kindly greeting go alway.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Come wealth or want, come good or ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Let young and old accept their part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bow before the Awful Will,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And bear it with an honest heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who misses or who wins the prize,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Go, lose or conquer as you can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if you fail, or if you rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be each, pray God, a gentleman.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A gentleman, or old or young!<br /></span>
<span class="i1">(Bear kindly with my humble lays);<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sacred chorus first was sung<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Upon the first of Christmas days;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherds heard it overhead,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The joyful angels raised it then;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glory to heaven on high, it said,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And peace on earth to gentle men.<br /></span>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">My song, save this, is little worth;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">I lay the weary pen aside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wish you health, and love, and mirth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As fits the solemn Christmas-tide.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As fits the holy Christmas birth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Be this, good friends, our carol still&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be peace on earth, be peace on earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To men of gentle will.<br /></span>
